# **Lifestyle and Health Factors in Diabetes Risk**
### *A Statistical Analysis Using BRFSS Data*

---

## **Overview**
This project analyzes the impact of lifestyle and health behaviors on diabetes risk using the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) dataset. By leveraging R for statistical analysis and predictive modeling, we identified key factors contributing to diabetes risk, such as BMI, physical activity, and blood pressure.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical tests (chi-square, t-tests) to identify significant variables.
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling with Random Forest and XGBoost for diabetes risk assessment.
- **Visualization**: Clear graphs and charts for BMI, physical activity, and blood pressure trends.
- **Reproducible Workflow**: Analysis conducted in R using R Markdown, with results exported to HTML.

## **Results**
- **Key Findings**:
  - Higher BMI, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure are strongly linked to increased diabetes risk.
  - Predictive models achieved high accuracy in identifying individuals at risk.
- **Implications**:
  - Early interventions targeting modifiable risk factors can significantly reduce diabetes prevalence.
